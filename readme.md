# Rainbow Rotation

This JavaScript code generates a rainbow pattern and applies a rotating animation to it using the HTML canvas element. The rainbow consists of seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The rainbow rotates continuously, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.

## How it Works
